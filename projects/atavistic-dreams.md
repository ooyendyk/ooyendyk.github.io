<p>Atavistic-Dreams, is a project to generate art through the use of machine learning.</p>

<p>I started out by scraping digital art from instagram. This dataset was then fed into styleGAN, and trained for 2000 epochs.</p>

<p>The resulting model was used to generate images, which were then pased to another ML algorithim,
SRCNN to upscale the images from 1042x1042 to 4096x4096.</p>

<p>The entire project only took about three hours to go from idea to completion</p>
