My first ever game, Jumpy Run, is a 3D side-scroller that plays like an easy-mode Floppy Birds.

I developed the first playable prototype in an evening after downloading the Unity game engine on a whim.

Over the next day, I polished the gameplay, added a main menu, scoring and uploaded the release.

[Flop-Chat](https://github.com/ooyendyk/flop-chat) is a simple flask and socket.io chat app inspired by Slack.
