### AKA: eatSpot

#### Intro:
[eatSpot](https://github.com/ooyendyk/WDC-GroupProject) is restaurant booking site like [OpenTable.com](OpenTable.com),
that I made as part of a university project. Initially it was supposed
to be a group project, but I ended up doing it solo as no one on my team
responded to my messages or showed up to class 😕.

For this project I used express.js (node.js) for the routing, 
sass/Bootstrap for the styling, and pug for templating. 

Unfortunately I never quite got around to finishing the project. Whist,
the front-end is mainly complete, the back-end has a [fair way to go](https://github.com/nerd-1/WDC-GroupProject/projects/2).
